  - DialogueOptionText: About the dwarven mine
    Talk: Once the dwarven mine out there used to be a really good prosperous place
      to work for dwarves. But now it became a frightening nest of evil and only
      few dwarves made it to survive and escape from this horrible place. Be careful
      when coming to this place, the evil skeletons, demons and even dwarves allied
      to them are really powerful to us.

  - DialogueOptionText: Rumors
    Talk: Some people say that someone from our town used to have to do with necromancy
      and because of that the horde of skeletons and demons besiege our town. If
      it's true then I can't believe in this that really happened.
